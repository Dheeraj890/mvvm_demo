Graph Ql Api's Point-:

1)Rest Api's are comparitively slow in compare to today demand's for a high speed of data
 transmission between client and server.

2)Rest Api's download those data also which are of no use for clients,which make api's more heavy and increase the computattion time of server and client.

3)GraphQl Api help us to reduce the data and computation time by getting only that data which is more useful.

4)Graph Ql also reduce the number of api's exposed to client in any application.

5)Eliminate the problem of overfetching and underfetching.
